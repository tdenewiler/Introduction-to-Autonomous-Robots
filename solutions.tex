Forward Kinematics:

(1)

1. Write out the entries of a rotation matrix $^A_BR$.

Solution:

\begin{equation*}
\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A   \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A
\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A   \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A
\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A   \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A
\end{equation*}

2. Express $\hat{X}_B=[0, 1, 0]^T$ in frame $\{A\}$.

Solution:

\begin{equation*}
\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A
\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A
\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A
\end{equation*}

3. Now calculate $^B_AR$:

Solution:

\begin{equation*}
\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A  \hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A   \hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A
\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A   \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A
\hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A  \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A   \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A
\end{equation*}

4. Verify that the solution from (2) indeed reduces to $[0, 1, 0]^T$ when expressed in coordinate system $B$. Tip: Express multiplications as scalar products and remember that the scalar product of orthogonal vectors is $0$ and that of parallel vectors is $1$.

Solution:

The solution consists of a $1 \times 3$ vector that is obtained by multiplying the $1 \times 3$ vector from (2) with each row of $^B_AR$.  The first entry is:

\begin{equation*}
[\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A   [\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A+
\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A  .  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A+
\hat{X}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A]    \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A]
\end{equation*}

The first vector is $^A\hat{X}_B$ and the second vector is $^A\hat{Y}_B$. As they are orthogonal, their scalar product is zero.

The second entry is:

\begin{equation*}
[\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A  [\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A
 \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A . \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A
 \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A]  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A]
\end{equation*}

Both vectors are identical and their scalar product is one.

The third entry is:

\begin{equation*}
[\hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A   [\hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{X}_A
 \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A .  \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Y}_A
 \hat{Z}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A]   \hat{Y}_B\cdot\hat{Z}_A]
\end{equation*}

The first vector is $^A\hat{Z}_B$ and the second vector is $^A\hat{Y}_B$. As they are orthogonal, the scalar product is zero.

(2)

Consider two coordinate systems $\{B\}$ and $\{C\}$, whose orientation is given by the rotation matrix $^C_BR$ and have distance $^CP$. Provide the homogenous transform $^C_BT$ and its inverse $^B_CT$.

Solution:

\begin{equation*}
[
    ^C_BR    ^CP
	0   0   0   1]
\end{equation*}
